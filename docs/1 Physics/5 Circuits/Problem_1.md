# Problem 1

Great! Here's a complete solution for the **Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory** problem, using Python and the `networkx` library.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Core Algorithm Features**

- **Simplifies circuits using series and parallel reduction.**
- **Handles arbitrary resistor networks, including nested configurations.**
- **Falls back to an advanced solver (nodal analysis) for complex circuits.**

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Key Concepts Explained**

- **Series Detection**: If a node has exactly two neighbors and isn't an endpoint, we replace the two connecting resistors with a single equivalent resistor (`R1 + R2`).
- **Parallel Detection**: If multiple edges exist between the same pair of nodes, replace them with a single equivalent resistor using `1/Req = 1/R1 + 1/R2`.
- **Advanced Solver**: For non-trivial graphs with multiple paths, we solve a reduced conductance matrix (via nodal analysis) to compute equivalent resistance.

---

### ðŸ§ª **Tested Examples**

1. **Triangle graph with a shortcut** (`A-B-C`, `A-C`).
2. **Parallel resistors** (`A-B` with two parallel resistors).
3. **Square with diagonal connection** (cycle with potential simplification via nodal analysis).

---

### ðŸ“ˆ **Efficiency and Improvements**

- Current implementation simplifies using repeated graph rewrites â€” good for medium-size circuits.
- For large graphs: Consider optimizing graph traversal and pattern matching using depth-first search with memoization.
- For cyclic graphs: Integration with more robust linear algebra backends (e.g., `scipy.sparse`) would improve performance.
