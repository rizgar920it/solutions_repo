Here’s a polished **single‑presenter film‑style script** for your NotebookLM presentation. It includes **designed narration**, **visual cues**, and **image aids** to clearly explain each symbol in the wave equation for high school students.

## 🎬 Opening Scene — “Ripples of Discovery”

**Visual**: Calm pond; one pebble drops, ripples spread.
**Presenter (to camera)**:
“Imagine dropping a pebble into water. Ripples spread in circles. Now, drop two pebbles—those ripples meet. Today, I'll guide you through how waves **interact**, using just one simple equation.”

---

## 🎯 Scene 1 — Present the Full Equation

**Visual**: Equation appears clearly on screen:

**Presenter**:
“This is our wave equation for a **point source**. Let’s unpack it symbol by symbol.”

---

## 📐 Scene 2 — **A** = Amplitude

**Visual**: Arrow from equation to an animated crest on top of the wave diagram.
**Picture**: Illustrates crest and trough labeled.
**Narration**:
“$A$ is the **amplitude**—the height of a wave crest above calm water. More energy = higher waves.” ([youtube.com][1], [phys.libretexts.org][2])

---

## 📏 Scene 3 — **r** = Distance

**Visual**: Dot labeled ‘source’, with a line to a point (x, y); labeled “r”.
**Narration**:
“$r$ is the **distance** from the point source to where we measure the wave. Notice the amplitude also shrinks with $1/\sqrt{r}$ — waves spread out and get weaker.”

---

## 🔢 Scene 4 — **k** = Wave Number

**Visual**: k arrow points to “kr” in equation, then to wave with two crests; label distance λ.
**Narration**:
“$k$ is the **wave number**, given by $k = 2π/λ$. It tells us how many wave cycles fit in a meter—more cycles = more waves packed in.”&#x20;

---

## ⏱️ Scene 5 — **ω** = Angular Frequency

**Visual**: Arrow from ω to “ωt” term and clock icon showing seconds tick.
**Narration**:
“$ω$ (omega) is the **angular frequency**, from $ω = 2πf$. It tells us how **fast** the wave oscillates—more cycles per second = quicker waves.” ([mathematicalmysteries.org][3])

---

## 🎛️ Scene 6 — **t** = Time

**Visual**: Animated clock with increasing t; wave shifts in sync.
**Narration**:
“$t$ is **time**. As time progresses, the term “$ωt$” makes the wave’s crest move outward.”

---

## 🎚️ Scene 7 — **φ** = Initial Phase

**Visual**: Two identical waves—one shifted horizontally. The one shifted is marked “+φ”.
**Narration**:
“$φ$ (phi) is the **phase shift**. It tells us if the wave starts early or late. Imagine starting your ripple later—this shift moves the whole wave forward or backward.” ([mathsisfun.com][4])

---

## 🧮 Scene 8 — Putting It Together

**Visual**: Full equation with each term highlighted in its color as it’s described.
**Narration**:
“So the equation says: **strength** by $A/\sqrt{r}$, times **cosine** of the total wave phase: **space** ($kr$), **time** ($ωt$), and **start** ($φ$). All wrapped in cosine because waves follow that shape.”

---

## 🎨 Scene 9 — Visual Summary Slide

**Visual**: Side-by-side bullet chart:

* $A$: amplitude → height
* $r$: distance → spread
* $k$: wave number → spatial frequency
* $ω$: angular frequency → oscillation rate
* $φ$: initial offset → timing shift

**Presenter**:
“Every part tells a story—how tall, how fast, where, and when a wave travels.”

---

## 🚀 Finale — Invite Interaction

**Visual**: Presenter steps forward.
**Presenter**:
“Now, it’s your turn! You can adjust these symbols to create your own wave patterns—or go further into **interference**, where two or more waves cross. Want me to build slides, show animations, or guide live scripting? Just say the word!”

### ✅ What You Can Do Next

Let me know which you’d like:

1. 🎞 Create **PowerPoint/Google slides** with visuals for every symbol.
2. 🎬 Generate **animated clips** showing each term in action.
3. 📝 Build an interactive **NotebookLM script** using these materials.
