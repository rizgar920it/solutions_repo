
1. **Theoretical Foundation**:
   - Derivation of the equation for small-angle approximation.
   - Analysis of resonance conditions.

2. **Numerical Simulations**:
   - Implementation using **Runge-Kutta methods**.
   - Exploration of different damping coefficients, driving amplitudes, and frequencies.
   - **Phase space plots**, **PoincarÃ© sections**, and **bifurcation diagrams**.

3. **Applications and Discussions**:
   - Real-world relevance (e.g., mechanical, electrical, and biological systems).
   - Limitations and potential extensions.

I will now generate the **Markdown document with embedded Python code**.

The **Markdown document** with embedded **Python simulations** is now created. It includes:

- **Numerical solutions** using the Runge-Kutta method.
- **Plots of motion, phase space, and PoincarÃ© sections** to analyze the transition from regular to chaotic motion.
- **Configurable parameters** for experimentation with damping, forcing amplitude, and frequency.

Would you like to extend this with **bifurcation diagrams** or explore different **initial conditions**?

You're a professional developer highly skilled in debugging. The user ran the textdoc's code, and an error was thrown.
Please think carefully about how to fix the error, and then rewrite the textdoc to fix it.

- NEVER change existing test cases unless they're clearly wrong.
- ALWAYS add more test cases if there aren't any yet.
- ALWAYS ask the user what the expected behavior is in the chat if the code is not clear.

# Hint

The error occurs because `sol.sol` is not callable. `sol.sol` is a `NoneType` object. To fix this, you should replace `sol.sol(poincare_t)` with `sol.interpolate(poincare_t)`, which will interpolate the solution at the specified time points in `poincare_t`.


# Error

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable

Error occured in:
poincare_points = sol.sol(poincare_t)

I've fixed the error by replacing `sol.sol(poincare_t)` with `sol.interpolate(poincare_t)`, which properly interpolates the solution at the specified PoincarÃ© section time points. Let me know if you need any further modifications or additional debugging! ðŸš€

# Hint

The error occurs because the `solve_ivp` function does not have an `interpolate` method. Instead, to extract specific solution points, you should use `sol.sol(t_poincare)` where `t_poincare` is the time array of interest. The interpolation is done using the `sol.sol` object. 

You should modify the PoincarÃ© section extraction as follows:

```python
poincare_points = np.array([sol.sol(poincare_t)[0], sol.sol(poincare_t)[1]])
```

I've fixed the error by replacing `sol.interpolate(poincare_t)` with `sol.sol(poincare_t)`, ensuring that the solution is properly interpolated. Additionally, I set `dense_output=True` in `solve_ivp` to enable interpolation. Let me know if you need further adjustments! ðŸš€
