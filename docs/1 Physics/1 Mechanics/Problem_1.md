# Problem 1
Governing Equations of Projectile Motion

Projectile motion is described by fundamental kinematic equations that account for motion in two perpendicular directions: horizontal and vertical. Assuming no air resistance, the equations for motion are:

Horizontal Motion:

where  is the initial velocity,  is the launch angle, and  is the time of flight.

Vertical Motion:

where  is the acceleration due to gravity.

The projectile reaches its peak height when the vertical velocity component becomes zero:

Since the motion is symmetric, the total time of flight is:


Deriving the Range Equation

The range  is the horizontal distance covered by the projectile when it returns to the same height (assuming it starts from ground level). Using the time of flight in the horizontal equation:

Substituting :

Using the identity , we obtain:


Analysis of Range Dependence on Angle

Maximum Range Condition:

The range is maximized when  is maximized, which occurs at , i.e., .

This means that, for a given initial velocity, the projectile attains its maximum range at a launch angle of 45 degrees.

Symmetry in Angle Dependence:

The function  is symmetric about 45 degrees, meaning that angles  and  produce the same range.

For example, a projectile launched at 30° and 60° will have the same range, but different maximum heights and times of flight.

Effect of Initial Velocity and Gravity:

Higher initial velocities result in greater ranges.

Greater gravitational acceleration (e.g., on different planets) reduces the range.

Conclusion

The range of a projectile depends crucially on the launch angle, and the optimal angle for maximum range in a uniform gravitational field is 45 degrees. The quadratic relationship between range and angle highlights the symmetry in projectile motion, and the presence of multiple parameters allows for a broad application of these equations to real-world problems such as ballistics, sports, and aerospace dynamics.
